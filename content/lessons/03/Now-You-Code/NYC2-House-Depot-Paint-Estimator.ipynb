    "# Now You Code 2: House Depot Paint Estimator\n",
    "\n",
    "The big-box hardware store *House Depot* as contracted you to write an App to estimate the amount of paint required to paint a room. Given that 1 gallon of paint covers 400 square feet, you must output the number of paint cans required to paint a rectangular room.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should input:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the length of the room in feet, \n",
    "- the width of the room in feet,\n",
    "- the height of the room in feet\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- total area to be painted ( sum of each of the 4 walls)\n",
    "- the number of gallons of paint required to paint the room.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter length of room: 12\n",
    "Enter width of room: 14\n",
    "Enter height of room: 8\n",
    "Total area to be painted: 416.00\n",
    "Total gallons of paint requried: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "HINT: Use the `math.ceil()` function to round your number of gallons up to the nearest whole number \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Start out your program by writing your TODO list of steps you'll need to solve the problems.**\n"
